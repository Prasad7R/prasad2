<caption><b><center><font size=8>How the COVID-19 contingency affects children.</b></center></font></caption>
Background:
Due to the pandemic, children are undergoing many changes in their daily lives.
Methods:
We analyzed how parents perceive the effects of the contingency on their children through an online survey shared by digital media for 7 days.
Results:
We obtained 4000 responses. The most frequent difficulty of the children was online homeschooling (30.4%), followed by sleeping disorders (20.3%). The use of screens increased 30-80% in over 65% of children. Tantrum was detected in 34% and mood swings in 30% of children. The majority of parents (77.8%) considered that distance education does not guarantee children's education and that the level of learning acquired through online classes is not the same as that of face-to-face education (83.5%). In contrast, 70.6% of parents considered that it is not yet time to reopen schools, 78.8% believed that there is sufficient evidence to keep them closed, and 45% indicated that it is better not to return to campus this year. Regarding activities to improve mental health during the contingency, 51.3% have created home games, and 23.6% perform physical activity. However, 74.4% do not have the peace of mind to restart daily life. Among the positive aspects of the contingency, adaptability (35%) and family union (33.5%) were reported.
Conclusions:
Health professionals in contact with children must be prepared for the problems that this contingency is generating and sensitize parents to observe their children and seek professional help on any alarm data on the emotional or behavioral state of the child.			

Coronavirus Vaccine
On Dec. 11, 2020, the FDA granted an emergency use authorization (EUA) in the U.S. for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Within a week, that agency also granted an EUA to a vaccine developed by Moderna. Johnson & Johnson's single shot vaccine was granted EUA in February, 2021. 

The British government approved and began to give the Pfizer vaccine on Dec. 8, 2020. Vaccines developed in China and Russia are now also being given in several other countries. 

Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require two doses, taken a few weeks apart while J & J is just one shot. Health care workers and the elderly were originally given priority in receiving the vaccines but by May, the vaccines were made available to anyone over the age of 12 years-old.

These vaccines were developed at an unprecedented speed, with testing in humans starting in March 2020. The FDA says that no corners were cut to allow for approval and that the innoculations are safe. The CDC has said it is safe for pregnant women and there's no evidence that antibodies formed from COVID-19 vaccination cause any problem with pregnancy,.

Clinical trials for other vaccines are still underway. If you're interested in volunteering for a COVID-19 vaccine trial, here are some sources of more information</font><br>
